quiet-purple
------------

A port of quiet-purple theme for metacity with redesigned buttons.

Original readme file follows :

This theme is my first one, without counting keramik-Gyellow that was only an 
edited version of the keramik theme. My target was to have a smooth and 
"eye-relaxing" theme that was intuitive to use and also a bit original. 
So I've used prelight for unfocused buttons (try to move the mouse over 
buttons of a unfocused window), I've designed the restore (from maximized 
state) button as a toggle button and I've not put the maximize, minimize 
and close symbols over the unfocused buttons.

COLORS
------
I would like to make new versions of this theme in other colors; 
if you have any particular preference just send me a e-mail! Thanks.

INSTALLATION
------------
Just unpack into your ~/.metacity/themes directory and use either 
Metacity Setup or gconf-editor to switch theme.
