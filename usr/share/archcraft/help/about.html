							<h1>About</h1>
							<p class="major">Archcraft is a minimal and resource friendly Linux distribution, Which is based on Arch Linux.</p>
							<p>Archcraft is very <strong>lightweight</strong> and it can run under 500MB of memory. It only uses window managers and a few lightweight applications.
							<br>Archcraft has two window managers, openbox (<i>stacking wm</i>) and Bspwm (<i>tiling wm</i>). Openbox is the default window manager.
							<br>Flat and pastel colors, the consistency among different UI elements and various themes for each WM make Archcraft look and feel very unique, clean, minimal and stunning.
							<br>It has built-in support for AUR, Snaps, Flatpak. Which means, despite being lightweight and beautiful, It's powerful too and it gives you the power to do whatever you want on your Linux PC.
